Local and Instance Variable
=======================================
Local variable
-----------------------------
Local variables are the variable which are declared within method, constructor or blocks. They are
created once method, constructor or block is invoked.

***FACTS****
It is mandatory to initialize the variable before using, otherwise we will not able to compile the
code.


Instance Variable
---------------------------------------
Instance variable are the variable which are declared in class but outside the method, constructor
and blocks.
Called instance variable because there values are unique to each instance of class.

***FACTS***
-- THERE IS NO CONCEPT OF GLOBAL VARIABLE IN JAVA
-- If you do't initialize, java will assign the default values for instance variable.
-- To use instance variable in a static method/class, need to create an object

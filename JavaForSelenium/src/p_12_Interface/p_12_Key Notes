Interface
================================================
Interface is a special class which contains variables and which can not be changed. It contains the
method declaration only not the method body. INTERFACE IS 100% ABSTRACT CLASS.
Example: Calculators basic functions

****FACTS****

Syntax:

	variables;
	methods();
}

****INTERVIEW QUESTIONS****
-- Child class reference and Child class object --> all the methods of Base and Child class
-- Base class reference and Base class object --> Can not create object of an interface
-- Base class reference and Child class object --> all the methods of Base class only


1. Why we can not object create of an interface?
   -- If the class is not fully implemented, we will not allow to create object.In interface we
   don't have even one method which is fully implemented as it's 100% abstracted.

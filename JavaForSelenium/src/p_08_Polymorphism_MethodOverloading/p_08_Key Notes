Polymorphism
=========================
Poly means many. Polymorphism means one thing in multiple forms.

There are two types of polymorphism:
1. Compile time/Early binding (Overloading)
2. Run time/Late binding (Overriding)

Method Overloading
----------------------------
Method can be overload if and only if method has the same name but with different signatures.

Signatures depends on:
-- Number of arguments
-- Type of arguments
-- Order of arguments

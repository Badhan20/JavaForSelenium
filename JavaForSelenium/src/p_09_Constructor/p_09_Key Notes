Constructor and Constructor Overloading
===========================================
Constructor
---------------------------------
Constructor is a block of code which is used to construct/initialize the value.
In java, constructor is used to initialize the value.

There are two types of constructor:
1. Default Constructor (No-argument)
2. Parameterized Constructor (Have arguments)

****FACTS****
-- Has the same name as class name
-- Doesn't have any return type
-- Get invoked automatically by creating the object
-- Can not be static, final, abstract, and Synchronized

Constructor overloading
--------------------------------------
Constructor can be overloaded by using the same constructor multiple times with
the different signatures.

Signatures depends on:
-- Number of arguments
-- Type of arguments
-- Order of arguments

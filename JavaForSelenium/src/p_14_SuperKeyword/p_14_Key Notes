Super Keyword/Reference Variable
=================================
Super Keyword
------------------
-- Super is one of the reserved keywords in java. Also called as reference variable.
-- Super keyword can be used with variable, methods and constructor
-- Super keyword is used during inheritance concept.

Super Keyword Usages
----------------------------------
1. With variable - When parent class and child class has the same variable with same
   name and if child class want to access the parent class variable, in that case will
   use the super keyword.
   super.keyword

2. With method - When parent class and child class has the same method name and want to
   call the parent class method, in that case will use the super keyword.
   super.method()
   super.method(a,b)

3. With constructor - Whenever need to call base class constructor from child class, can
   use super()
   super()
   super(a,b)
   
***NEED TO REMEMBER***
-- super() should be the first statement in the child class constructor
-- If do not call base class constructor, then by default java internally calls base class
   constructor with zero argument
-- If base class does't have zero argument constructor, the java will throws compile time
   exception.
-- When child class calls constructor of parent class and again if parent class calls the
   constructor of grandparent class, then this process is called as constructor chaining.

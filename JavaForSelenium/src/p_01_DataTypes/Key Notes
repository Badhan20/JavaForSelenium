Variable
============================
Variable is the name of memory location to store values. We use variable to store data and
use the data when it is required. There are two types of variable: Local variable and Global variable

Global variable: Define in the class level, not inside any method
Local variable: Define inside method/block.

****Facts*****
-- Global variable contains Null/Default values.
-- Local variable contains garbage values. 

Data Types
============================
Data type is nothing but a keyword.
There are two types of data:
1. Primitive
2. Non-Primitive

Primitive
-----------------------------
Data Types		Default Value		Default Size
-------------------------------------------------
boolean			FALSE				1 bit
char			'\u0000'			2 byte
byte			0					1 byte
short			0					2 byte
int				0					4 byte
long			0L					8 byte
float			0.0f				4 byte
double			0.0d				8 byte

Non-Primitive
-------------------------------
String
Arrays
Classes
Interfaces etc..


=====INTERVIEW QUESTION==============
1. Can we declare a value like char a=65?
   -- Yes, we can. In that case,  the a will print the USINCODE table value for 65.
   
2. In which data type java store a fractional value?
   -- Java always store a fractional value as double.
   
3. How can we convert a float value/define a float value without using double?
   -- By type casting. float a = (float) 65.78.
   -- By using 'f' in the value. float b=67.34f;
   
4. What will be the output for int x = (int) 65.34;
   -- It will print only the value before the fraction. So, it will print 65
   
5. What is Casting? What are the types of casting?
  -- To convert one data type into another data types is called casting.
  There are two types of casting:
   -> Down-Casting: Converting the higher data type to lower data type (float-->int)
   -> Upper-Casting: Converting the lower data type to higher data type (float-->double)
   
6. Can we print a local value without initialization?
  -- No, we can not. We must need to initialize value for a local variable before printing as the
  local variable contains garbage value and java doesn't support garbage value.
